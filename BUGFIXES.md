# Bug Fixes Applied to FlashSaver Bot

## 1. Fixed Asyncio Event Loop Issues
**Problem**: RuntimeWarning about coroutines never being awaited and "no current event loop" errors
**Solution**: 
- Simplified progress callback handling in `core/downloader.py`
- Removed problematic `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` call
- Added proper exception handling to ignore progress updates when no event loop is available

## 2. Fixed Telegram API Timeout Issues
**Problem**: "Bad Request: query is too old and response timeout expired" and "message can't be edited" errors
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all Telegram API calls
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when message editing fails
- Reduced progress update frequency from every 5% to every 10% to minimize API calls
- Added proper error handling for callback answers

## 3. Removed Emojis from Inline Buttons
**Problem**: Emoji characters in inline keyboard buttons
**Solution**: 
- Removed all emoji prefixes from inline keyboard buttons in `bot/keyboards/inline.py`
- Kept only essential navigation emojis (◀️ ▶️) for pagination
- Cleaned up quality, format, compress, admin, and broadcast confirmation keyboards

## 4. Fixed .part File Issues
**Problem**: Partial download files (.part) being sent instead of complete videos
**Solution**: 
- Added `'no_part': True` to yt-dlp options to prevent .part file creation
- Added file filtering to exclude .part files from download results
- Improved file detection logic to ensure only complete files are processed

## 5. Improved Video Compression
**Problem**: Large video files causing upload failures
**Solution**: 
- Added automatic compression for video files larger than 20MB
- Implemented smart compression that preserves resolution while reducing file size
- Added proper cleanup of original files after successful compression
- Enhanced compression algorithm with better bitrate calculation

## 6. Added Bot Username to Downloaded Files
**Problem**: No attribution in downloaded files
**Solution**: 
- Added dynamic bot username detection using `bot.get_me()`
- Modified caption format to include "Downloaded via @{bot_username}"
- Added BOT_USERNAME environment variable as fallback
- Created .env.example file with all required variables

## 7. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: Poor error handling causing bot crashes
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Implemented graceful degradation when operations fail
- Added proper logging for debugging
- Ensured bot continues functioning even when individual operations fail

## 8. Improved Download Process
**Problem**: Unreliable download process with multiple failure points
**Solution**: 
- Added better file detection after download completion
- Implemented automatic retry mechanisms
- Enhanced progress tracking with better error handling
- Added proper cleanup of temporary files

## Files Modified:
- `main_enhanced.py` - Main bot logic improvements
- `core/downloader.py` - Download manager fixes
- `bot/keyboards/inline.py` - Emoji removal from buttons
- `utils/constants.py` - Added BOT_USERNAME constant
- `.env.example` - Environment variables documentation

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test with various video URLs (YouTube, Instagram)
2. Verify large file compression works correctly
3. Confirm no .part files are created or sent
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, invalid URLs)
5. Verify bot username appears in captions
6. Test both small and large file downloads
